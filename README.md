# FUTURE-ENGINEERING-ASSISTANT
Abstract

The Future Engineer Assistant (FEA) is an innovative, AI-powered web application designed to facilitate personalized career guidance for engineering students. Built on the Shiny platform and powered by advanced generative AI technology, the FEA serves as an interactive chatbot that engages students in dynamic conversations to explore potential career pathways. As the engineering field continues to evolve, numerous challenges present themselves to students in their pursuit of suitable career choices. The FEA addresses this challenge by providing tailored career recommendations through an engaging user experience.

Upon login or registration, users are introduced to a structured flow that consists of several key components. The application begins with a detailed registration process where users provide essential personal details, including their academic background, interests, and demographic information. Following registration, users must confirm their completion of a pre-survey aimed at collecting data pertinent to their career aspirations, thereby paving the way for the next phase – personalized career path prediction.

One of the hallmark features of the FEA is its ability to generate personalized questions through the Gemini API, designed to capture users' preferences, skills, and aspirations through a series of free-response inquiries. Once users complete this survey, the FEA leverages the responses to suggest specific career paths tailored to the unique profiles of engineering students, thereby enabling them to make informed decisions about their future.

In addition to career path prediction, the application houses a powerful salary prediction feature, allowing users to inquire about the expected salary for various engineering positions based on their experience levels. This functionality is vital for providing financial insights that students must consider when evaluating potential career options. Furthermore, the application includes a conversation module where users can directly engage with the chatbot, posing queries related to their predicted careers, educational paths, and skills. The chatbot employs natural language processing to understand users’ inquiries and provide relevant advice and insights, enriching the user experience.

The FEA not only emphasizes career recommendations but also fosters student engagement through a "Quick Glimpse" feature. This feature compiles a personalized summary of the user's selection of career paths, presented in an organized table format, enabling easy dissemination and comprehension of the information provided. Users can also download their career path predictions and salary responses in CSV formats, ensuring that they retain access to their personalized recommendations for future reference.

Recognizing the importance of user feedback, the FEA incorporates structured methodologies, including pre- and post-surveys, to evaluate its impact on the users' confidence and knowledge regarding career choices. This iterative feedback mechanism allows the application to adapt and evolve based on student needs, ensuring its relevance as a career counseling resource.

Moreover, the application features a user-friendly interface designed with a modern aesthetic, enhancing the overall accessibility of the chatbot. Students can engage with the FEA using text or audio inputs, broadening accessibility and creating an inclusive environment. The introduction of voice recognition capabilities allows for a more hands-free interaction, catering to diverse user preferences.

In conclusion, the Future Engineer Assistant stands as a pioneering solution to bridge the gap between education and career planning for engineering students. Through its interactive chatbot interface, personalized career path predictions, and salary insights, the FEA empowers students to navigate the complexities of career selection confidently. By utilizing cutting-edge technology and user-centered design, the FEA aims to elevate the career exploration process, serving as a vital tool for students embarking on their professional journeys in the engineering domain.
